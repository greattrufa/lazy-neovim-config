## Awesome Neovim Configuration

This configuration is desighed for personal usage with the C/C++ programming languages and can easily be modified (Hopefully easily)

## Requirements

For this configuration to work you should have:

- The latest version of [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) should work
- The Clang C/C++ compiler (Used to make the LSP and formatter work)

This should be everything you need to get started with the installation. If it doesn't work try installing `Python` and `Nodejs` as well

## How to install?

It should be easy.

Just use this command to clone:

For Linux (And probably MacOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greattrufa/lazy-neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

For Windows:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/greattrufa/lazy-neovim-config.git $HOME\AppData\Local\nvim
```

Now you should be set
